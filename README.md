# Create a webpage with an input form

## About this project
This project was done as a mini challenge in a codind bootcamp as part of the process to learn about HTML / CSS. I created a webpage that meets the following criteria from scratch.

- uses semantic HTML elements
- uses universal, element, and class selectors in CSS.
- features at least three colors in the design.
- uses a single font and font family for all text.
- uses at least two heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`).
- header is fixed to the top of the page on scroll.
- header contains a navigation bar with three links that display inline, including a contact link.
- if the contact link is clicked, the page jumps directly to the contact form.
- the contact form includes `input` elements for name and email.
- the contact form includes a Send button.
- the image includes a descriptive `alt` attribute.
- the page is deployed to GitHub Pages.

## How I addressed this challenge

To address this project, I mostly relied on the things I learnt from the class in the past few days, namely,

- Semantic elements are elements whose name represents the type of the content such as `<header>` `<section>` instead of non-semantic elements such as `<div>`
- Use `*`: universal selector, `element name`: element selector, `.classname`: class selector
- Specify background, font and boarder colors in CSS
- Specify cont family in CSS using `font-family:`
- Use heading elements `<h1>` ~ `<h6>` to organize contents in a hierarchical order
- Use `position: fixed;` to fix the element at the specific position in the page
- Hyperlink to another content in the page using the `<a href="#id"></a>`
- Use HTML element `<input type="">` to add an input form to the page
- Use HTML element `<button type="button"></button>` to add a button to the page
- Add alt text to the image by using `alt=""` inside of the `image` element
- Push the updated file to my repository on GitHub by going through the git add > commmit > push process
- Deploy the page to the GitHub page by following the process described in [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
